		  <h3>Genesis</h3>
		  <p>The project was inspired by my experience as a teaching assistant for the course.
		    Being in the back of the room, I could see not only the teacher and the projected slides,
		    but also what students were viewing on their laptops.
		    I also was called upon to help students when they ran into difficulties.</p>
		  <h3>Proposal</h3>
		  <p>This is a proposal for changes to the slides for Class 4 that are displayed by the teacher and viewed by the students,
		  both in class and when preparing for or reviewing their class experience.
		  The original slides were prepared by the national Girl Develop It organization,
		  and have been modified by several GDI teachers.
		  The <a href="https://gdibtv.github.io/gdi-core-html-css/class4.html" target="_blank">version on GitHub that I forked</a>
		  is one that was modified for classes at my local GDI branch, Burlington VT.</p>
		  <p>Based on a conversation I have had with local GDI organizers, my understanding is that
		  the slides evolve over time, as organizers become aware of the needs of the teachers and students.
		  Implementation of changes are generally constrained by available time.
		  This is why, rather than merely suggesting changes, I have coded them.
		  I am very open to partial adoption of these changes, as well as making additional changes at the request of the organizers.
		  These changes take into consideration observations I made of student behavior, and what I know about organizing material.
		  Veteran teachers may have different preferences based on their experiences in leading the classes,
		  which I would greatly respect when receiving feedback.
		  </p>
		  <h3>Changes made so far (<a href="https://kunikla.github.io/gdi-core-html-css/class4.html" target="_blank">view here</a>)</h3>
		  <p>
		  So much work has gone into making these slides (!) that I was careful to change only the format, not the content.
		  The biggest change has been to organize the explanatory text and examples in a consistent manner.</p>
		  <p>
		  Visible changes
		    <ul>
		      <li>Closely related material is organized into a single set of vertical slides, all with the same title.</li>
		      <li>The explanatory text is on the first vertical slide, with fragments revealed one by one.</li>
		      <li>Examples (other than code samples embedded in the explanatory text) are organized in subsequent vertical slides, with one example per page.</li>
		      <li>Each example has a caption above it.</li>
		      <li>All CodePens are displayed rather than referenced in a link ("backup" text and links are maintained).</li>
		      <li>The display area for each CodePen is big enough that the relevant results are visible without having to visit the CodePen.</li>
		    </ul>
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  Invisible changes
		    <ul>
		      <li>The code uses standard indentation.</li>
		      <li>The start of each major section is indicated by a comment.</li>
		    </ul>
		  </p>
		  <h3>Changes under consideration</h3>
		  <p>
		  For the Z-index slides:
		    <ul>
		      <li>Make the sample output match the embedded sample code colors</li>
		      <li>Put the embedded sample code and sample output on a separate vertical slide (space considerations)</li>
		      <li>For the sample output, add a visible border to the div containing the positioned divs</li>
		      <li>Make "before" and "after" slides for the embedded sample code, similar to other examples</li>
		    </ul>
		  For slides displaying a CodePen
		    <ul>
		      <li>Include embedded sample code on that slide that highlights the important features of the code in the Pen.
			Due to space considerations, only the most relevant code would be displayed.</li>
		    </ul>
